--- Odin4 GUI Frontend For Linux ---

‚úÖ Tested
üëç Easy To Use
üêç Uses Python (PyQt5)
‚ÄºÔ∏è Need to run pre-setup.sh before using the Odin4GUI Executable

Disclaimers:
- I am not held responsible for any damage caused to your devices, I tested this with my phone and it worked fine, if you are unsure about this then flash something small, such as TWRP which only affects recovery on a secondary device, or read the py file to verify.
- The pre-setup script only supports Debian based distros with APT package manager, if your Distro is not Debian based then manually install Python3 and PyQt5 before running the script (Non Debian Based distros not tested with this script so report bugs if any.)
- After running the script do not modify any of the locations of the files in this folder or in other folders, otherwise reinstallation needed or relocating the files to their correct directories, you  can only move Odin4GUI desktop file, such as the Desktop for easy access

Instructions:
1) run chmod +x on the pre-setup.sh file
2) Open terminal in this folder
3) Run the script by running ./pre-setup.sh
4) Finished
5) Use Odin4 GUI
